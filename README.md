# Interior Reverse Auction Platform (Rails)

An interior renovation reverse auction platform built with Ruby on Rails.

This project is a marketplace-style web application where customers post interior renovation projects and contractors compete by submitting bids in a reverse auction model, helping users find the best price and service efficiently.

## 🏗️ What is a Reverse Auction?

Unlike traditional auctions, a reverse auction allows multiple contractors to bid downward on a project.  
Customers can compare offers, timelines, and contractor profiles before making a decision.

This model encourages transparency, competition, and cost efficiency in interior renovation projects.
